connect

log id and url of person we connected to (and name?)

linkedin emails be about the acceptance of the connection request

figure out who it was and update the table to "connecttion accepted"
next column is "message sent" bool and date of acceptance

1 day later you blast them

totally autommatable if linkedin emails are sent to us.


table

ID, li url, invite_sent_at, accepted_at, messaged_at
